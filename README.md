# Updated-SSG-Reynolds-stress-model-in-OpenFOAM
The existing SSG Reynolds stress model in OpenFOAM was modified based on literature. The modified code files are useful to simulate turbulence-driven secondary currents and their interactions with the other flow properties under supercritical uniform flow conditions for linear or curvilinear cross-sections (such as archway, circular, and horseshoe).
